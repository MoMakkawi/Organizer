# Summary:
Organizer a tool called that automates the process of organizing system architecture files and folders based on the developerâ€™s preference. 
So, that could be used by the client to organize the structure of their source code. 
This will result in more usable source code as it will be easier to surf, access and read.

# General idea:
This project is in the field of **Re-architecting** , It generates source code files and folders.
this project presents a Console Project and many libraries created with Roslyn for .NET developers. the project presented is called Organizer. 
It meant to organize any unorganized C# code as requested by the client, by restructuring the base types (classes, interfaces, records, enumerations, structs) 
in different folders and files according to the needs of the client using a set of services. 
The meaning of unorganized code in the scope of The Organizer is C# code files full of base types.

## The services provided by the Organizer are:
 * A service to create folder(s) to contain generated files.
 * A service to include base type(s) in a specific generated folder depending on a type name or a pattern.
 * A service to change the name(s) of specific type(s) depending on a base type name or pattern of multiple base types.
 * A service to ignore type(s) depending on a base type name or a pattern of multiple types.
 * Ability to exclude specific types from the creation or update patterns depending on a type name.
